This is the color changing square app.


METHODOLOGY:
First, make a list of the colors you want to include in the project. You will use this list to create buttons for each of them. Create a variable to check if it is tapped or not and and an empty 
string, this will be used as a key for the button action function. When a button is tapped it should turn the tap variable true and make the key the name of that color (use a for each loop here)
Make a function with conditionals for all of the colors and will return a rounded rectangle in that color. After the button, check if the tap boolean is true or not. If it is, call the rectangle 
function using the key from the button that was tapped.
