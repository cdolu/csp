This is the walking man app. A set number of frames in a man walking, ten in this case, are cycled via button.

METHODOLOGY:
First, make a list of the frames you want to include in the project. You will use this list to store the titles for each of your images. Create a 
variable to store the image title that will be shown at that moment and a zero-value integer variable, which will be used to keep track of the order 
of images. When the button is tapped it should check if the image is the last one in the last and make the number zero again. If not, add one to the 
integer and use that to get that element from your list and store it in the title variable. After the button, add an image with the title variable.
